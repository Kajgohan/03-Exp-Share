    <h1> Instructions </h1>
    <p>The purpose of this activity is to study <b id="pop">popout!</b> We want to see how good you are at spotting an <b class="blinking">outlier!</b> But
      really, since we are going to extrapolate this data and assume that you lot are the least unique/extraordinary lot possible, we are going to see how
      good these outliers are at being <bdi id="upside"> spotted </bdi>________ by you! Your job is simple: As soon as you hit the Start button, a scatter
      plot will appear over most of the screen for a split second, so be ready. Your goal is to determine if there were any outliers. Then, on the following
      page, all you have to do is indicate if there was an <bdi id="opq">outlier</bdi> or not. Press Q for yes and P for no, and the test will automatically run again.
        Then, when you are bored you can click to exit.
      Thanks for participating!
